Gatsby Netlify CMS Template.

Installed with only Netlify CMS Support

To run development server:

> gatsby develop

Clean development server:

> gatsby clean

Steps Taken:

1. npm init gatsby
2. Only added Netlify CMS - no other plugins (they caused it to fail?!)
3. First commit, new repository.
4. Add repository as a new project in Netlify
5. Enable Identity
6. Registration, Enable GitGateway. Default Settings
7. Getting errors in Netlify on build. SOmething to do with Resolving Dependencies.
